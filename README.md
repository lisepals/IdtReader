# IdtReader

## What it is
This is a side project (small bunch of related classes) to read a very versatile file format we found useful for our own use. Inside the $Begin(<id>) and $End tags, everything that can be expressed in text can be used.

These classes have been used from several years noew and are pretty stable.
